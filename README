NetBreakServer for CS2114 Group Project

The NetBreakServer is currently lauched by calling `java NetBreakServer`.
This will lauch the server on port 2114. Optionally you can pass in an
alternative port as a command line argument.

Currently, logging in will give you a "WAIT" prompt, then once you have
been matched it will send the IP of the matched partner.
